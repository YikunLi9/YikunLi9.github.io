Multipath TCP (MPTCP) is one of the leading [transport layer protocols](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/transport-layer-protocol) that enables multipath transmission to improve network performance. However, MPTCP can experience throughput degradation due to link congestion, which causes underutilizing of the network capacity. We proposed a new link congestion detection based on Software-Defined Networking (SDN) for MPTCP that detects and detours link congestion to achieve a stable MPTCP performance. Measurement results show that the proposed scheme enables efficient [packet transmission](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/packet-transmission) by minimizing the effect of link congestion. Moreover, a combination of the proposed scheme and SDN monitoring enables dynamic traffic control based on the proposed link congestion detection.
