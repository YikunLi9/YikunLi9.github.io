CarbonMap is a web-based tool developed to visualize carbon intensity data across the UK, aimed at helping regional governments and businesses in implementing and monitoring decarbonization strategies. This interactive platform displays real-time and historical carbon intensity data, allowing users to understand regional energy consumption patterns and carbon emission levels. It provides a functional interface for effective decision-making in reducing carbon emissions, thereby contributing to the overall goal of achieving net zero targets.
