One Touch is a new generation IoT system that allows users to perform DIY tasks through mobile devices.   It combines AR (Augmented Reality), MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport), database, and other technologies to visualize connections between various devices in an IoT system.   This is achieved using QR codes and barcodes as a medium, enhancing user experience with AR technology for intuitive operation and control of physical-world devices through virtual objects, and enabling device communication and control flexibility.
