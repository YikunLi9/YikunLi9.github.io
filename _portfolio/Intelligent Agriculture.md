The project uses an Arduino as the main controller and integrates various sensors, including temperature and humidity sensors, light sensors, and soil moisture sensors. These sensors continuously monitor key parameters of the farm or plants and send the data back to the Arduino controller. Additionally, the Arduino processes this data to display on an LCD screen and performs operations such as heating, supplementary lighting, or watering based on these data. Communication between Arduino is accomplished through the I2C protocol.
