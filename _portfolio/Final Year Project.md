This project focuses on improving network performance in SDN (Software-Defined Networking) environments using MPTCP (Multipath TCP). It introduces a novel congestion detection algorithm and a sophisticated traffic control mechanism. By identifying congestion levels in the network, the project's solution dynamically reroutes MPTCP subflows from congested links to less congested ones. This approach aims to optimize overall network throughput, reduce latency, and balance congestion across the network, thereby enhancing the efficiency of data transmission in SDN settings.
